# Movie Sleuth

Movie Sleuth is a web application that allows users to search for movies and TV shows by name and retrieve information such as the title, year, genre, cast, duration, language, IMDB rating, and a brief plot summary, along with a poster image. The app communicates with an external API to fetch the relevant data. If a user searches for a title that doesn't exist in the database, the app displays a "Movie not found" message.

## Features
- Search Functionality: Users can search for any movie or TV show by entering its name in the search bar.
- Dynamic Content Display: The app displays information about the movie or show, including a poster, title, year, genre, cast, duration, language, IMDB rating, and a plot summary.
- Error Handling: If a user searches for a title that does not exist, the app will gracefully display a "Movie not found" message.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5: Structure of the web pages.
- CSS3: Styling of the application, including layout, colors, and responsiveness.
- JavaScript: Handles the dynamic behavior of the app, including API requests and DOM manipulation.
- API Integration: The app fetches data from a movie and TV show API.

## What i learned
- API Integration: I learned how to connect to a third-party API, handle the data returned from it, and render that data dynamically on a webpage.
- Error Handling: I implemented error handling for scenarios where a user's search does not return any results, ensuring that the app remains user-friendly and informative even when no data is found.
- DOM Manipulation: Through JavaScript, I gained more experience in manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) to update the content displayed to the user based on their interactions with the app.
- Debugging and Testing: I enhanced my debugging and testing skills by identifying and fixing issues that arose during the development process, ensuring smooth functionality.
